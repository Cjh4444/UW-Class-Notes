# Topic: Recurrence

## Todo:
- [ ] Heaps Programming - DUE Friday Jan 24th
- [ ] exercise something - Due Monday Jan 27th

## Notes:
### Recursive Algorithm Analysis
- Do non-recursive work, do recursive call(s), do non-recursive work in calls, repeat until base case reached
- Running Time = $T(n) = T(p_1) + T(p_2) + ... + T(p_x) + f(n)$
  - T(n) = total runtime
  - T(p) = recursive runtime
