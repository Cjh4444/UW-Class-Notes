# Topic: Phonetics

## Todo:
no new tasks

## Notes:
### Definition
- Scientific study of human speech sounds
  - How they're produced (articulatory)
  - How they're perceived (auditory)
  - Their physical properties (acoustic)
  - NOTE: Sign language has equivalents for all of these, but for this class just focus on audible language
### Decoding speech stream
- Speech is continuous, there's no audible spaces between words, but we still hear each word as a discrete unit
  - It's very hard to look at frequency readings and extract the # of words
### Vocal Tract Anatomy/Uses
- Active Articulators
  - Velum (soft palate)
  - Tongue
  - Bottom Lip
  - Vocal Folds
- Passive Articulators
  - Top Lip
  - Teeth
  - Alveolar Ridge
  - Postalveolar region
  - Hard Palate
  - Velum (soft palate)
  - Uvula
### IPA
- Standardized set of symbols for depicting human speech sounds
- One-to-one correspondence between symbol and sound
- IPA vs Orthography
  - Same letter represents different sounds
    - d**a**d vs f**a**ther vs **a**bout vs m**a**ny vs **a**te
