### Course Motivation/Goals
- Main Topic: Probability Theory
    - Sub-topics:
        - Combinatorics
            - Permutations, combinations, (in/ex)clusion, pigeonhole principle
        - Formal def of probability
            - Probability space, events, conditional probability, independence, expectation, variance
        - Common patterns in probability
            - Equations and inequalities, "zoo" of random variables, tail bounds
        - Continuous probability
            - pdf, cdf, sample distributions, central limit theorem, estimating possibilities
        - Applications
            - Across CS generally, some focus on ML
- Applications: ML, Natural Language Processing, Cryptography, ECC, Data Structures, Compression, Complexity Theory, Algorithmic Design
- Themes
    - Precise
### Start of Counting Rules
- Sets
    - Cardinality is the number of elements in set
        - {1,2,3} has cardinality of 3
        - |{1,2,3}| = 3
- Sum Rule
    - If choosing between n options in group 1 and m options in group two, total number of options is n + m
- Product Rule
    - If you have a sequential process, where step 1 has $n_1$ options, step 2 has $n_2$ options, ..., step k has $n_k$ options, and you choose one from each step, the total number of possibilities is $n_1 * n_2 * ... * n_k$
