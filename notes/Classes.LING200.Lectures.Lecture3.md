# Topic: Design features, animal communication

## Todo:
no new tasks

## Notes:
### What is a Language?
- Charles Hockett said that human language has 9 distinct differences from other forms of communication
    - Languages must have all 9 features
### Design Features of Communication Systems
- 3 features shared by all communication systems (including languages)
    - Mode of communication:
        - How information is conveyed and received
    - Semanticity:
        - All sounds/signals have meaning
    - Pragmatic:
        - Information must be useful in some way
- 6 features shared by some communication systems
    - Interchangeability
        - A given user can both convey and understand messages
            - Example of contrary
                - Female silk worms excrete chemicals (their communication system apparently?) that that males can't
    - Cultural Transmission
        - System is learned from others, not genetically inherited
    - Arbitrariness
        - There isn't necessarily a connection between form of signal and its meaning
    - Discreteness
        - Larger messages can be broken down into smaller, discrete, parts
    - Displacement
        - Ability to communicate about ideas not present in space/time
    - Productivity
        - Users can create an infinite number of novel messages that other users can understand
